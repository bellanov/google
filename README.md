**Terminal User Interface (TUI)** to visualize _Google Cloud Platform (GCP)_ resources.

## Environments

The project is deployed across multiple *environments*, each of which has its own Terraform configuration.

![Environments](./diagrams/Environments.svg)

| Environment | Description |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| _development_ | Development environment for testing and experimentation.          |
| _staging_   | Staging environment for pre-production testing.                   |
| _production_| Production environment for live deployment.                       |

*Terraform* configurations are located in the `terraform/environments` directory.

### Environment Variables

The project relies on *environment variables* to execute.

Be sure to be authenticated (via `gcloud auth login`) and define the `$GCP_PROJECT` and `$GCP_ORGANIZATION` variables.

```sh
# Project
export GCP_PROJECT=gcp-development-12345
export GCP_ORGANIZATION=12345678901
```

### Workload Identity Federation

The project uses *[Direct Workload Identity Federation](https://github.com/google-github-actions/auth?tab=readme-ov-file#preferred-direct-workload-identity-federation)* to manage identities and access across different environments.

In this setup, the Workload Identity Pool has direct IAM permissions on Google Cloud resources; there are no intermediate service accounts or keys. This is preferred since it directly authenticates GitHub Actions to Google Cloud without a proxy resource. However, not all Google Cloud resources support principalSet identities, and the resulting token has a maximum lifetime of 10 minutes. Please see the documentation for your Google Cloud service for more information.

| Workflow | Description |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| _cli-ci-\<environment\>_     | Continuous Integration workflow for testing and validating the `cli`.  |
| _cd-\<environment\>_     | Continuous Deployment workflow for *Terraform* deployments.  |
